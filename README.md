Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹ This is my Github profile and I prefer Verilog over VHDL.
You can find a few repos and also mini projects built in GoLang.

You may find my fav MATLAB project and Iverilog repo. I keep updating the samples in the repos. They are open for all. You can check them out and if you have any suggestions, consider commenting there below.
