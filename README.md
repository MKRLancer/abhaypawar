Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹ This is my Github profile and I prefer Verilog over VHDL.
You can find a few repos and also mini projects built in GoLang. You can find my Matlab based projects and Icarus Verilog repository, which have updated project samples, which can help you get started. 

I also help orgs translate into Indian Languages.
